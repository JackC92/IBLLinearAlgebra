IBLLinearAlgebra
================

IBL stands for Inquiry Based Learning and is an approach
to teaching that maximizes the time a student spends with
the material.  This project is to create a series of 
Linear Algebra problem-sets to guide students through the
concepts of a one-term first course in linear algebra.
