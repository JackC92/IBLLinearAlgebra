IBLLinearAlgebra
================

IBL stands for Inquiry Based Learning and is an approach
to teaching that maximizes the time a student spends with
the material.  This project is to create a series of 
Linear Algebra problem-sets to guide students through the
concepts of a one-term first course in linear algebra.

In `/dist` you will find a document containing
Linear Algebra questions that closely follow the order
of topics presented in *Introduction to Linear Algebra for Science and Engineering*, Second Edition
by Norman and Wolczuk.


LaTeX Code
----------

A few macros were created to make typesetting these problem-sets
easier.  Peek at the code to see them!
