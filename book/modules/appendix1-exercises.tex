		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Show that with $\vec b=\mat{7 \\ 14}$, the system is
				consistent.

				$[M|\vec b]$ have the same number of pivots.

		\prob On Kokoro's farm, there is a cage with $35$ animals, some are chickens
		and some are rabbits. Kokoro counted the total number of legs in the
		cage and found that there were $94$ legs in all (notably, each chicken
		has exactly two legs and each rabbit has four legs). Kokoro then decided
		to use this information to figure out how many chickens and how many
		rabbits there were.\footnote{This problem is modified based on a
		classical Chinese problem, which first occurred in the ancient Chinese treatise
		\emph{Mathematical Classic of Master Sun} (or \emph{Sunzi Suanjing}).}

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Set up a system of linear equations representing this scenario.

			\item Is the system consistent? If so, give the complete solution.

			\item Kokoro wants to set up three other cages so that for each cage,
				one of the following conditions is satisfied, explain to Kokoro,
				using complete English sentence, if there exists a configuration
				of animals so that the condition is satisfied. If so, give her one
				such configuration. If not, explain to her why she cannot configure
				a cage to satisfy the condition.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Kokoro wants to set up the first cage with \emph{cats}
						and \emph{dogs} (notably, each cat has exactly four legs
						and each dog has four legs) so that there are $35$
						animals in total, and the total number of legs is $94$.

					\item Kokoro wants to set up the second cage with \emph{cats}
						and \emph{dogs} so that there are $35$ animals in total,
						and the total number of legs is $140$.

					\item Kokoro wants to set up the third cage with \emph{chickens}
						and \emph{rabbits} so that there are $42$ animals in total,
						and the total number of legs is $77$.
